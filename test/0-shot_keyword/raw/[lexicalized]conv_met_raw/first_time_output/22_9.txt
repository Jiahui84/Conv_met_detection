If:1

MR

MacSHANE

Labour
law
will
always
reflect:1
the
balance:1
of
power
in
society
and
a
fully+fledged
labour
court
system
will
not
remove
class
and
fundamental
employer-employee
differences

From
there
like:1
a
eyrie:1
its
in
buzzard
he
would
make
forays:1
round
the
US
and
abroad
in+spite+of
his
advanced
age

It
would
also
be
necessary
to
smash:1
the
decrepit
effete
constitution
that
allows
a
minority
to
capture:1
power
and
then
use
it
ruthlessly:1
in
the
interests
of
the
privileged
few

The
simple
answer
is
that
Chelsea
are
in
a
FALSE:1
position
and
Arsenal
on
this
evidence
slightly
jaded:1
champions

But
it
will
not
mean
that
we
are
abandoning
them

In
1986
according+to
Friends
of
the
Earth
a
survey
of
the
homes
clustered
on
the
surrounding
hills
found
that
three-quarters
of
800
residents
were
opposed
to
the
Rechem
plant

Zinc
is
the
latest
lack

little

supports
the

It

be
my
turn

Completion
normally
takes
place
four

eight
weeks
later

there
is
no
opportunity
for
second

Of

Clapham
indeed
accounts
for
nearly
half
the
77
fatalities
of
the
last
ten
years
compare
that
with
the
5
deaths
and
300
injuries
every
year
on
the
roads

Yet
the
ambulance
worker
is
only
being
offered
£10,000
when
a
fire
officer
is
being
given
£13,000
and
a
Metropolitan
police
constable
can
earn
£25,000
