Basic Task Description,"Your task is to detect conventional metaphors with an IOB tagging schema. Proceed as follows:

Analyze each sentence provided and write down each word separately, one word per row. Mark any conventional metaphorical word with ""B-ENT"". If the following word is also part of the conventional metaphor, mark it with ""I-ENT"". Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences.

Background Information with Metaphor Identification Process,"A conventional metaphor is a figure of speech that is widely used and understood within a culture, often so commonplace that it's considered a standard way of expressing a particular concept.

Background Information,"Context: Metaphors are figures of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it's not literally applicable. Conventional metaphors are of high frequency in daily usage and the meanings have been lexicalized in dictionary senses. 

Guidelines:

Pay close attention to words that represent one thing in terms of another.
Focus on widely recognized and used metaphors.
Only mark words that are explicitly metaphorical in the given context.

Based on the guidelines, process the following sentences with an IOB tagging schema. List every word from each sentence, one word per row, and mark conventional metaphorical words with ""B-ENT"". If the following word is also part of the conventional metaphor, mark it with ""I-ENT"". Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences.

Background Information with Metaphor Identification Process,"Objective: detect conventional metaphors within the provided sentences with an IOB tagging schema by considering the context and overall message. Analyze each sentence to differentiate between literal language and metaphorical usage.

Criteria for Conventional Metaphors:

1. The metaphorical usage must be of high frequency and commonly understood.
2. It should be conventional, meaning it's recognized in dictionaries with its metaphorical meaning.

Instructions:

1. Read each input sentence thoroughly to understand its context and intent.
2. Detect words or phrases used metaphorically.
3. Check if these metaphorical uses are common and listed in dictionary entries as such.
4. Compile a list of all the words from each sentence.
5. Mark conventional metaphors with ""B-ENT"". If the following word is also part of the conventional metaphor, mark it with ""I-ENT"".
