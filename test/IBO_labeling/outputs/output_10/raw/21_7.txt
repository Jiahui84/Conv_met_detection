1.
Given
the
already
appalling
and
growing	B-ENT
rate
of
homelessness
and
lack
of
hostel
facilities
in
London
when
more
people
than
ever
will
not
only
have
to
endure	B-ENT
the
freezing	B-ENT
nights
of
the
coming
winter
on
the
streets
but
perhaps
permanent
homelessness
it
was
terrible
to
see
the
situation
being
exploited	B-ENT
for
a
joke
by
your
advertisement
Just
the
thing
now
the
evenings
are
drawing+in	B-ENT

During
the
journey
East
German
officials
will
enter
the
train
and
collect
all
East
German
passports

3.
Provided
their
behaviour
was
sportsmanlike
and
safe
oarsmen
found
only
encouragement
and
humour
from
a
President
who
was
always
among
them

Losing	B-ENT
was
one
thing
but
to
lose
as
spinelessly	B-ENT
as
the
Welsh
XV
did
to
Bridgend
on
Saturday
was
to
add	B-ENT
insult	B-ENT
to
severely
injured	B-ENT
pride	B-ENT

6.
Others
are
not
so
well+informed	B-ENT

7.
The
hero
Francis
Mayne
is
suffering	B-ENT
from
the
adolescent
emotional
confusion
and
acute
self-consciousness

8.
So
of+course
does
alcohol
itself

CHAMPION

10.
So
they
should
and
when
the
list
of
necessities
is
securely
written+down	B-ENT
you
can
ask
the
second
question
How
do
I
want
this
garden
to
feel	B-ENT

11.
Pub
landlords
are
usually
only
too
happy
to
provide
free
accommodation

12.
Other
British
towns
Croydon
and
Southampton
among
them
are
also
considering
modern
tramways

13.
There
are
three
key
causes
of
the
shambles
Mr
Kenneth
Clarke
the
failure
to
separate	B-ENT
emergency
from
non-emergency
work
and
the
Whitley
Council
negotiating
machinery

14.
The
Health
Secretary
accused
the
unions
of
posturing	B-ENT
and
pretending	B-ENT
to
run
a
999
service
yesterday

15.
George
Graham
was
not
amused

16.
He
was
awarded
honorary
degrees
by
Algiers
Glasgow
and
Oxford

17.
Its
two
main
slogans
repeated
countless	B-ENT
times
in
the
directives
issued
by
the
underground
leadership
are
freedom
and
independence

18.
Harsh
measures
putting	B-ENT
an
entire
community
under
an
absolute
curfew
for
a
continuous
lengthy
period
of
time
demolishing	B-ENT
homes
uprooting	B-ENT
olive
or
citrus
trees
physical
intimidation
and
terror	B-ENT
tactics
employed
by
raiding
army
units
shooting
killing
cutting+off	B-ENT
water+supplies	B-ENT
or
electricity
and
telephone
links
to
villages
or
towns
mass
arrests
intimidatory
interrogation
techniques
can
either
create	B-ENT
a
temporary
lull
or
activate	B-ENT
an
eruption

19.
The
offices
of
R
and
B.
Lettings
are
now
up
for
sale

20.
Not
a
sign	B-ENT
of
spring
had
yet
penetrated	B-ENT
this
secret
valley
but
another
month
would
put
that
right
