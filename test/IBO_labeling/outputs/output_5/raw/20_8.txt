It
does
not
matter
whether+or+not
DRG
makes
sellotape
or
Basildon
Bond
it
's
of
no
consequence	B-ENT
to
anybody
if
somebody
else
makes
them

In
his
minute	B-ENT
inaccessible	B-ENT
capital
which
today
has
only
15
inhabitants
Nicholas
erected
a
miniature	B-ENT
European
court
and
an
exquisitely
furnished
Victorian
palace

FISA
was
then
a
relatively
unimportant
body
which
organised
European
and
other
championships
and
participated
in
the
running	B-ENT
of
Olympic
regattas

In+spite+of
his
gift	B-ENT
to
the
sport
Keller
was
anxious
not
to
abuse	B-ENT
his
status
as
President
and
never
went
to
a
rowing
event
unless
invited

The
village
is
a
fantastic	B-ENT
institution
and
they
make
people
happier

Employment
in
agriculture
still
the
main
rural
industry
fell
from
over
a
million
in
the
mid-Sixties
to
under
100
now

Had
either
of
the
teams
won
they
would
have
taken	B-ENT
the
League
leadership

But
Dr
Runcie
ideas
of
a
limited
primacy
recognising
the
Pope
as
a
central	B-ENT
figure
in
the
Christian
Church
who
would
exercise	B-ENT
a
primacy
for
the
sake
of
unity
and
mission

Stack
emissions
of
PCBs
were
below
the
American
standard
for
breathing	B-ENT
air
1
times
lower
than
the
British
equivalent

That
is
not
thirst

Precisely
next
door
to
this
is
a
restaurant
called
The
Great
House

Scott
first
venture
into
this
unlikely
field
of
design
was
at
Battersea
where
in
1930
he
was
wheeled+in	B-ENT
as
a
famous
knighted
architect
by
the
London
Power
Company
to
try
to
make
acceptable
the
coal-fired
monster	B-ENT
power+station
to
which
the
residents
of
Chelsea
and
Westminster
were
taking	B-ENT
strong
exception

So
do
the
Chinese
press
statements
asserting
that
Hong
Kong
is
entirely
a
business	B-ENT
between
China
and
Britain
and
should
not
be
discussed
formally
or
informally
at
any
international
forum

For
Mrs
Bujok
it
was
argued
that
the
1936
Act
was
designed
to
secure
in
the
interests
of
the
community
at+large
that
statutory
nuisances
did
not
exist

He
finds+out
what
the
needs
of
the
business
are
and
prescribes	B-ENT
the
cure

Crucial
to
the
development
process
is
the
relationship
built+up	B-ENT
between
the
analyst
and
the
user

It
would
further
naturalise	B-ENT
and
legitimise	B-ENT
the
evolving
skeletal	B-ENT
form	B-ENT
of
Palestinian
independence

Howard
Keizner
of
Landlords
said
There
were
a
lot
of
complications	B-ENT
with
this
particular
letting
and
management

The
theory
is
that
its
internal
air+pocket
will
bounce	B-ENT
back
the
dolphin
sonar
signal
regardless
of
the
direction
of
approach
