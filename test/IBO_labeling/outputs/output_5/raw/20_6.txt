1. IT
SEEMS	B-ENT
that
Roland
Franklin
the
latest
unbundler	B-ENT
to
appear
in
the
UK
has
made
a
fatal	B-ENT
error

That
point
about
the
core	B-ENT
business
is
very
unfair	B-ENT
he
says

To
add
the
part-time
education
and
training
statistics
to
those
figures
does
not
improve
our
relative	B-ENT
position

For
many
years
Thomson
lived
in
New
York
in
his
apartment
at
the
Chelsea
Hotel

It
does
not
imply
political	B-ENT
supremacy
and
does
not
suggest
that
the
Pope
should
administer
the
affairs
of
the
Church
of
England
he
said

They
too
reacted
with
water
and
a
plant
operator
was
burned	B-ENT
by
a
cloud	B-ENT
of
acid
gas

Sometimes
he
is
reminded
of
several
things

The
Iznik
pottery
from
Turkey
dating
from
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
explodes	B-ENT
with
colour
on
more
sophisticated
white
grounds
Iznik
is
now
highly
sought	B-ENT
after
by
Turkish
yuppies
and
prices
run
from
ÃÂ£2,000
or
so
to
ÃÂ£15,000

But
then
do
the
French
Spanish
or
Italians
have
a
word
for
it

The
summer
sprawl	B-ENT
begins
to
be
oppressive	B-ENT
at
this
stage
in
the
year
and
trigger	B-ENT
fingers
are
itching	B-ENT
to
snip+back
overgrown
mallows
clear+out
the
mildewing
foliage
of
golden
rod
and
reduce
the
overpowering
bulk
of
bullyboy	B-ENT
ground
cover

Privacy
is
an
important
consideration

I
have
no
doubt
that
others
will
be
added

If
there
is
a
failure	B-ENT
of
imagination	B-ENT
to
use
the
royal
visit
creatively
it
will
also
be
a
failure	B-ENT
of
nerve	B-ENT

The
only
two
Hong
Kong
legislators
who
consistently
dare
to
speak+out
Mr
Martin
Lee
and
Mr
Szeto
Wah
have
been
threatened	B-ENT
with
expulsion
from
the
committee
now
drafting
China
post-1997
Basic
Law

Leinster
face
an
uphill	B-ENT
task

Most
of
them
are
probably
muttering
I
'm
too
busy
to
get
involved
in
this
sort
of
thing

OVERNIGHT
FILE

A
mile
above
the
shepherd
hut
the
hillsides
ceased
their
upward
rolling
and
curved
together
to
form
a
dead-end	B-ENT
valley
of
broad-breasted	B-ENT
slo that
five
miles
from
the
nearest
tarmac
road
hidden
deep
in
the
folds	B-ENT
of
the
moors

He
's
better
looking	B-ENT
on
TV
