1. Letter
Policy
and
politics	B-ENT
at
the
Labour+Party
Conference

2. A
letter
dropped	B-ENT
through	I-ENT
the
post
from
the
President
of
the
Socialist
Republic
of
Montenegro
inviting
me
to
the
funeral
said
John
Kennedy
a
Conservative+Party
member
who
lives
in
Barking
and
is
a
distant	B-ENT
relative

3. Another
response
to
a
visual
stimulus
was
Thomson
series
of
musical	B-ENT
portraits

of
people
such+as
Picasso
and
Aaron
Copland

4. But
the
villages
are
dying	B-ENT
becoming	B-ENT
suburbs
or
dormitories
where
few
people
work
but
many
sleep

5. It
takes
all
sorts

6. The
phrase
universal
primacy
has
a
spiritual
meaning

7. In
Liverpool
a
dockers
spokesman
with
the
Transport
and
General
Workers
Union
admitted
Drivers
are
n't
happy
handling	B-ENT
some
of
these
commodities
but
at+least
a
lorry-driver
has
more
idea
of
what
he
is
handling
than
a
docker
who
could
have
a
consignment
and
just
not
know
what
it
is

8. Dr
Slevin
agreed
that
this
is
often
beneficial
but
is
concerned
about
other
aspects
of
such
therapies

10. If
Dedham
Hall
is
fully
booked
and
it
may
well
be
try
the
best
bed-and-breakfast
we
have
ever
found
just
a
few
miles
away
at
the
Old
Vicarage
Higham
near
Colchester

11. The
loveliest
to
my
mind
is
Melford
Hall
whose
charming	B-ENT
octagonal
Jacobean
gatehouse
is
reached
along
an
avenue
of
clipped	B-ENT
yew
trees
and
with
its
high
windows
flooding	B-ENT
the
octagon
with
light
is
my
fantasy	B-ENT
of
the
ideal
study

12. And
they
told
it
without
on-screen
questioning
though
the
programme
is
skilfully
structured
to
give
it
a
coherence
it
might
have
lacked

13. From
the
resulting
corner
Rhodes
made
another
fine
save
hurtling	B-ENT
to
his
right
to
deflect	B-ENT
away
Dixon
rising	B-ENT
shot

14. We
trained
on
an
artificial
pitch
for
two
days
this
week
and
we
should
have
done
a+lot
better

15. The
user
tells	B-ENT
the
analyst
what
the
problems
are
and
the
analyst
decides
at+least
in
broad
terms
what
the
user
requires

16. Entire
departments
can
be
set+up
in
health
foreign
affairs
agriculture
trade
finance
education
justice
religion
information
and
social
welfare

17. Wriggling	B-ENT
across
country
on
the
D216
to
Port-d'Envaux
you
come
to
two
more
chateaux
18th-century
Panloy
flaking	B-ENT
romantically	B-ENT
away
on
its
hillock
overlooking
a
bend
in
the
Charente
and
almost
next
door
the
much
older
moated
Crazannes
half-smothered
in
amazing
flamboyant
Gothic
carving

18. The
core
of
the
problem
is
simple
the
National
was
invited
to
New
York
only
last
November
and
the
Kirov
is
planning
to
tour
this
summer
