1. But
its
last
effort
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
set+up
by
Harold
Wilson
and
headed
by
George
Brown
ended	B-ENT
in	I-ENT
futile	B-ENT
departmental
and
ministerial
infighting

But
while
the
DTI
would
override	B-ENT
the
Treasury
a
new
powerful
Department
of
Consumer
Affairs
would
antagonise	B-ENT
the
DTI

Labour
would
be
acquiescing	B-ENT
in	I-ENT
a
democratic
outrage
if
it
continued
arguing
that
because
the
Conservatives
had
got
away
with
being
undemocratic
for
so
long
it
was
now
Labour
turn

While
telecottages
should
become
self-financing
once
established
they
do
need
initial
subsidy

Villages
are
expensive
to
live
in
and
if
they
are
to
become
vibrant	B-ENT
communities
again
local
people
must
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
be
able
to
continue
living
in
them

Mr
Smith
said
in
an
interview
on
BBC
television
's
On
the
Record
that
he
did
not
expect
his
colleagues
to
spend	B-ENT
and
spend
again'	B-ENT
when
they
took
office

Doctors
are
worried	B-ENT
that
women
turning
to
prostitution
to
finance
the
habit
are
at
risk	B-ENT
of
contracting
Aids

We
do
not
drink
because
we
are
thirsty

Globe
artichokes
are
sprouting	B-ENT
new
leaves
and
may
need
protection
from
frost
in
cold
areas

We
're
trying
to
smooth	B-ENT
the
path
for
purchasers
and
streamline	B-ENT
the
system
says
Graham
Harrison
pointing+out
that
live
telephone
bidding
will
also
be
available
for
those
unable
to
attend

Although
collective
property
auctions
take
place
regularly
in
London
often
primarily
for
investors
rather+than
house-hunters
in
country
areas
the
more
typical
auction
will
be
just
for
one
house
and
as
likely
as
not
will
take
place
in
a
nearby
pub
or
village
hall

And
although
the
supertram
concept
will
spread	B-ENT
through
major
cities
during
the
next
decade
Blackpool
will
still
be
alone
in
its
use
of
traditional
double-deckers

Armstrong
seems
the
least
permanently
damaged	B-ENT
on
the
surface

Under
strain
for
a
start
because
it
was
technically
ill-equipped
to
avert
disaster
or
to
cope	B-ENT
with
the
consequences
when
disaster
struck
under
strain
from
commercial
pressures
which
as
the
inquiry
puts
it
compromised
safety
under
strain
above
all
because
the
people
on
the
spot
could
n't
or
would
n't
cope
were
weary	B-ENT
from
gruesome	B-ENT
working
hours
the
senior
signal
technician
who
heads
the
list
of
the
culpable
had
had
only
one
day
off
in
the
past
13
weeks
lacked
adequate
training
or
simply
could
n't
be
bothered

In
law
there
was
no
doubt
that
Mrs
Bujok
was
entitled
to
commence	B-ENT
proceedings

He
took	B-ENT
it
on	I-ENT
the
chin	B-ENT

In
the
meantime
we
have
the
capacity
to
bring
coherence	B-ENT
and
organisation
to
a
whole
range
of
activities
further
consolidating	B-ENT
the
institutional
linkage
between
the
people
in
the
occupied
state
and
the
PLO
leadership

The
age
structure
of
Meadowell
means
it
is
awash	B-ENT
with
teenagers
whose
only
pastimes
are
having
babies
and
body-building

Like
the
heckler
he
was
a
Liberal
