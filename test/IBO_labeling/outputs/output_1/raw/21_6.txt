1. IT
SEEMS	B-ENT
that
Roland
Franklin
the
latest
unbundler	B-ENT
to
appear
in
the
UK
has
made	B-ENT
a
fatal	B-ENT
error
in
the
preparation
of
his
ÃÂ£697m
break-up	B-ENT
bid
for
stationery
and
packaging
group
DRG

2. That
point
about
the
core	B-ENT
business
is
very
unfair
he
says

3. To
add
the
part-time
education
and
training
statistics
to
those
figures
does
not
improve
our
relative
position

4. For
many
years
Thomson
lived
in
New
York
in
his
apartment
at
the
Chelsea
Hotel

5. It
does
not
imply
political
supremacy
and
does
not
suggest
that
the
Pope
should
administer
the
affairs
of
the
Church
of
England
he
said

6. They
too
reacted	B-ENT
with
water
and
a
plant
operator
was
burned	I-ENT
by
a
cloud
of
acid
gas

7. Sometimes
he
is
reminded
of
several
things

8. The
Iznik
pottery
from
Turkey
dating
from
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
explodes	B-ENT
with
colour
on
more
sophisticated
white
grounds
Iznik
is
now
highly
sought
after
by
Turkish
yuppies
and
prices
run	B-ENT
from
ÃÂ£2,000
or
so
to
ÃÂ£15,000

9. But
then
do
the
French
Spanish
or
Italians
have
a
word
for
it

10. The
summer
sprawl	B-ENT
begins
to
be
oppressive	B-ENT
at
this
stage
in
the
year
and
trigger	B-ENT
fingers
are
itching	B-ENT
to
snip+back
overgrown
mallows
clear+out
the
mildewing
foliage
of
golden
rod
and
reduce
the
overpowering	B-ENT
bulk
of
bullyboy
ground
cover

11. Privacy
is
an
important
consideration

12. I
have
no
doubt
that
others
will
be
added

13. If
there
is
a
failure
of
imagination
to
use
the
royal
visit
creatively
it
will
also
be
a
failure
of
nerve	B-ENT

14. The
only
two
Hong
Kong
legislators
who
consistently
dare	B-ENT
to
speak+out
Mr
Martin
Lee
and
Mr
Szeto
Wah
have
been
threatened
with
expulsion
from
the
committee
now
drafting
China
post-1997
Basic
Law

15. Leinster
face
an
uphill	B-ENT
task

16. Most
of
them
are
probably
muttering
I
'm
too
busy
to
get
involved
in
this
sort
of
thing

17. OVERNIGHT
FILE

18. A
mile
above
the
shepherd
hut
the
hillsides
ceased
their
upward
rolling
and
curved
together
to
form
a
dead-end	B-ENT
valley
of
broad-breasted	B-ENT
slopes
five
miles
from
the
nearest
tarmac
road
hidden	B-ENT
deep
in
the
folds	B-ENT
of
the
moors

19. He
's
better
looking
on
TV
