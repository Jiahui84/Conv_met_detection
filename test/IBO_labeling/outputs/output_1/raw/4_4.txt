1. Letter Policy
and
politics	B-ENT
at
the
Labour+Party	B-ENT
Conference

2. A
letter
dropped	B-ENT
through
the
post
from
the
President
of
the
Socialist
Republic
of
Montenegro
inviting
me
to
the
funeral
said
John
Kennedy
a
Conservative+Party	B-ENT
member
who
lives
in
Barking
and
is
a
distant
relative
of
Nicholas

3. Another
response
to
a
visual
stimulus
was
Thomson
series
of
musical	B-ENT
portraits	B-ENT
of
people
such+as
Picasso
and
Aaron
Copland

4. But
the
villages
are
dying	B-ENT
becoming	B-ENT
suburbs	B-ENT
or
dormitories	B-ENT
where
few
people
work
but
many
sleep

5. It
takes
all
sorts

6. The
phrase
universal
primacy
has
a
spiritual	B-ENT
meaning

7. In
Liverpool
a
dockers
spokesman
with
the
Transport
and
General
Workers
Union
admitted
Drivers
are
n't
happy
handling	B-ENT
some
of
these
commodities
but
at+least
a
lorry-driver
has
more
idea
of
what
he
is
handling
than
a
docker
who
could
have
a
consignment
and
just
not
know
what
it
is

8. Dr
Slevin
agreed
that
this
is
often
beneficial
but
is
concerned
about
other
aspects	B-ENT
of
such
therapies

9. By
STEPHEN
GOLD

10. If
Dedham
Hall
is
fully
booked	B-ENT
and
it
may
well
be
try
the
best
bed-and-breakfast
we
have
ever
found
just
a
few
miles
away
at
the
Old
Vicarage
Higham
near
Colchester

11. The
loveliest	B-ENT
to
my
mind	B-ENT
is
Melford
Hall
whose
charming
octagonal
Jacobean
gatehouse
is
reached
along
an
avenue
of
clipped
yew
trees
and
with
its
high
windows
flooding	B-ENT
the
octagon
with
light
is
my
fantasy	B-ENT
of
the
ideal
study

12. And
they
told
it
without
on-screen
questioning
though
the
programme
is
skilfully
structured	B-ENT
to
give
it
a
coherence	B-ENT
it
might
have
lacked

13. From
the
resulting
corner
Rhodes
made
another
fine
save
hurtling	B-ENT
to
his
right
to
deflect
away
Dixon
rising	B-ENT
shot

14. We
trained
on
an
artificial	B-ENT
pitch
for
two
days
this
week
and
we
should
have
done
a+lot
better

15. The
user
tells
the
analyst
what
the
problems
are
and
the
analyst
decides
at+least
in
broad	B-ENT
terms
what
the
user
requires

16. Entire
departments
can
be
set+up	B-ENT
in
health
foreign
affairs
agriculture
trade
finance
education
justice
religion
information
and
social
welfare

17. Wriggling	B-ENT
across
country
on
the
D216
to
Port-d'Envaux
you
come
to
two
more
chateaux
18th-century
Panloy
flaking	B-ENT
romantically	B-ENT
away
on
its
hillock
overlooking
a
bend
in
the
Charente
and
almost
next
door
the
much
older
moated
Crazannes
half-smothered	B-ENT
in
amazing
flamboyant	B-ENT
Gothic
carving

18. The
core
of
the
problem
is
simple
the
National
was
invited
to
New York
only
last
November
and
the
Kirov
is
planning
to
tour
this
summer
