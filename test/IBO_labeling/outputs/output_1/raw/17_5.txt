rule	B-ENT
a
large
south
Slav
kingdom
when
the

and
anti-sexism
seem
to
come	B-ENT
naturally	B-ENT
to
the
Ahlbergs

3. EACH
new
indignity
in
the
heap	B-ENT
visited	B-ENT
on
Welsh
rugby
seems
worse
than
the
last

4. What
of
this
thirst	B-ENT
that
can
be
satisfied	B-ENT
by
an
unquenching	B-ENT
drink

5. The
nearest+to
being
quenching	B-ENT
is
the
white
beer
of
Berlin

6. IN
THE
small
Devon
town
of
South
Molton
Julie

waiting	B-ENT
with
anticipation	B-ENT
for

7. His
successful
bid	B-ENT
was
for
ÃÂ£190,000
although
he
had
made
a
higher
prior
offer
which
had
been
turned+down

8. In
Britain
with
the
main
exception
of
Blackpool
not
forgetting
the
single-deckers
of
the
Isle
of
Man
and
Llandudno
trams
had
been
largely
relegated	B-ENT
to
the
history	B-ENT
books	B-ENT

9. The

have
their
own
vegetable
garden
chickens
ducks
sheep

10. Scott
was
so
pleased	B-ENT
with
the
style
he
had
evolved	B-ENT
at
Battersea
a
treatment
that
humanised	B-ENT
industrial
forms	B-ENT
without
denying	B-ENT
their
function	B-ENT
that
he
also
used
it
on
the
Guinness
Factory
at
Park
Royal
west
London

11. What
should
have
been
a
routine
exercise
in
extending	B-ENT
the
Government
borrowing+power
to
$3.1
thousand
billion
became
bogged+down	B-ENT
in
wrangling	B-ENT
over
legislative
initiatives
lawmakers
wanted
to
attach	B-ENT

13. Tiphook
confident

14. The
structure
of
the
developing
national
authority
has
been
both
diffuse	B-ENT
enough
to
prevent
it
from
being
destroyed	B-ENT
by
any
one
single
sweep	B-ENT
of
arrests
there
have
been
more+than
50

a
unified
resistance
strategy

it
Palestinians
are
struggling	B-ENT
on
a
daily
basis
to
shake+off	B-ENT
Israel
authority
and
to
construct	B-ENT

own

16. But
these
themes
are
always
interspersed	B-ENT
with
more
fanciful	B-ENT
ones
grimacing
masks
weird
animals
exuberant
abstract
patterns

17. When
built
in
1938
it
was
The

what
they
call	B-ENT
it
locally
