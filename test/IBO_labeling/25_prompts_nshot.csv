Pay close attention to words that represent one thing in terms of another.
Focus on widely recognized and used metaphors.
Only mark words that are explicitly metaphorical in the given context.

Based on the guidelines, process the following sentences. List every word from each sentence, one word per row, and mark conventional metaphorical words with an IOB tagging schema. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences.
