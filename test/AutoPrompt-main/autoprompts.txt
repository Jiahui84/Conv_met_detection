Carefully review the given sentences and classify each word or phrase accordingly. If a word or phrase is used as a conventional metaphor, conveying a meaning that differs from its literal one, and is commonly understood within the cultural context, label it with 'Yes'. If the word or phrase is used in a simile, employing 'like' or 'as' to create a comparison, it should not be labeled as a metaphor; instead, classify such instances correctly as 'No'. Additionally, make sure to correctly label established metaphors used to describe abstract concepts, even if no comparison is made, as 'Yes'. Avoid the pitfall of classifying literal expressions as metaphors; only phrases that are non-literal and carry an understood abstract representation within the culture should be labeled 'Yes'. For concrete, clear uses of language that do not imply an alternate abstract meaning, assign a 'No' label. This distinction is crucial to prevent the misclassification observed in prior attempts, where similes were mistakenly labeled as metaphors and some metaphorical expressions were overlooked.

Label 'Yes' for phrases that are non-literal and convey an abstract concept familiar within the cultural context, including those that are creatively coined or established metaphors expressing ideas like stability or change. Label 'No' for phrases used in their literal, direct sense, or when forming similes using 'like' or 'as'. Be particularly aware of phrases that might traditionally be misclassified as literal when they are indeed metaphorical, such as those that personify emotions or depict scenarios using natural phenomena in a symbolic way. Accurately distinguishing these cases is essential for reducing false negatives and improving precision in metaphor identification.

Analyze each sentence, paying close attention to the language used. Label words or phrases as 'Yes' if they serve as conventional metaphors, representing an idea or concept beyond their literal meaning, and are commonly recognized as such within the cultural context. Include both established metaphors like 'pillar of strength' for support and creative expressions that illustrate abstract ideas metaphorically, such as 'drowning in paperwork' to imply being overwhelmed. Label as 'No' any literal uses of language, direct descriptions, or comparisons made with 'like' or 'as' that do not imply a deeper abstract meaning. This classification is crucial for accurately identifying metaphors, including those that might have been previously mislabeled due to a lack of recognition of metaphorical intent.

Describe the task: Your task is to create an optimized functional prompt for the conventional metaphor labeling task.
Initial prompt: Context: Metaphors are figures of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it's not literally applicable. Conventional metaphors are of high frequency in daily usage and the meanings have been lexicalized in dictionary senses. Guidelines: Pay close attention to words that represent one thing in terms of another. Focus on widely recognized and used metaphors. Only mark words that are explicitly metaphorical in the given context. Based on the guidelines, process the following sentences, mark conventional metaphorical words with ':1'.

For each word in the sentence, determine whether it is used as a conventional metaphor or not. A word is labeled as a conventional metaphor ('Yes') if it is part of an expression that has a widely recognized figurative meaning and is commonly used to the extent that it is included as a standard figurative definition in dictionaries. If the word is used literally or its metaphorical use is context-specific, unusual, or not part of standard language (i.e., not included in dictionary figurative definitions), label it as 'No'. Ensure that metaphors related to human-like actions attributed to non-human entities, navigational metaphors, and metaphors describing fragility or instability are carefully considered for their conventional usage before labeling.

A conventional metaphor is a well-established figurative expression that is frequently used, easily recognized by speakers of the language, and has its metaphorical meaning clearly documented in standard dictionaries. Prioritize recognizing phrases that are established metaphors in the language, such as 'battleground' and 'bubbly personality,' which may be misinterpreted as literal expressions if not evaluated in context. Avoid classifying all instances as non-metaphors; carefully analyze the context to determine the metaphor status of each word or phrase.

Label each word or phrase as 'Yes' if it meets these criteria and is thus a conventional metaphor, or 'No' if it does not meet these criteria. Focus on the context to ensure that phrases often used metaphorically, like 'evaporated like morning dew' or 'courtroom was a battleground', are not mistakenly interpreted literally. Avoid misclassifying literal phrases with metaphorical implications, such as 'conversation was a minefield' or 'handshake is a delicate dance', as conventional metaphors.

Ensure that labels 'No' are also applied to expressions that seem metaphorical or are used in a metaphorical sense but lack dictionary documentation of their metaphorical meaning.
