IT:1
SEEMS:1
that
Roland
Franklin
the
latest
unbundler
to
appear
in
the
UK
has
made:1
a
fatal:1
error
in
the
preparation
of
his
£697m
break-up:1
bid
for
stationery
and
packaging
group
DRG

That
point
about:1
the
core
business
is
very
unfair
he
says

To
add:1
the
part-time
education
and
training
statistics
to
those
figures
does
not
improve
our
relative
position

For
many
years
Thomson
lived:1
in
New
York
in
his
apartment
at
the
Chelsea
Hotel

It
does
not
imply:1
political
supremacy
and
does
not
suggest:1
that
the
Pope
should
administer
the
affairs
of
the
Church
of
England
he
said

They
too
reacted:1
with
water
and
a
plant
operator
was
burned:1
by
a
cloud:1
of
acid
gas

Sometimes
he
is
reminded:1
of
several
things

The
Iznik
pottery
from
Turkey
dating
from
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
explodes:1
with
colour
on
more
sophisticated
white
grounds
Iznik
is
now
highly
sought:1
after:1
by
Turkish
yuppies
and
prices
run:1
from
£2,000
or
so
to
£15,000

But
then
do
the
French
Spanish
or
Italians
have
a
word
for
it

The
summer
sprawl:1
begins
to
be
oppressive
at
this
stage
in
the
year
and
trigger
fingers
are
itching:1
to
snip+back
overgrown
mallows
clear+out
the
mildewing
foliage
of
golden
rod
and
reduce
the
overpowering
bulk
of
bullyboy
ground
cover

Privacy
is
an
important
consideration

I
have
no
doubt
that
others
will
be
added:1

If
there
is
a
failure
of
imagination
to
use:1
the
royal
visit
creatively
it
will
also
be
a
failure
of
nerve

The
only
two
Hong
Kong
legislators
who
consistently
dare
to
speak+out
Mr
Martin
Lee
and
Mr
Szeto
Wah
have
been
threatened
with
expulsion
from
the
committee
now
drafting
China
post-1997
Basic
Law

Leinster
face
an
uphill:1
task

Most
of
them
are
probably
muttering:1
I
'm
too
busy
to
get
involved
in
this
sort
of
thing

OVERNIGHT
FILE

A
mile
above
the
shepherd
hut
the
hillsides
ceased
their
upward
rolling
and
curved
together
to
form
a
dead-end
valley
of
broad-breasted:1
slopes
five
miles
from
the
nearest
tarmac
road
hidden:1
deep
in
the
folds:1
of
the
moors

He
's
better
looking:1

TV
