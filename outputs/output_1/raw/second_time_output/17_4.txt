Conference

2. A
letter
dropped:1
through
the
post
from
the
President
of
the
Socialist
Republic
of
Montenegro
inviting
me
to
the
funeral

John
Kennedy

Conservative+Party
member
who
lives
in
Barking
and
is
a
distant
relative
of
Nicholas

3. Another
response
to
a
visual
stimulus
was
Thomson

of
musical
portraits:1
of
people

spokesman
with
the
Transport

some
of
these
commodities
but
at+least
a
lorry-driver
has
more
idea
of
what

could
have
a
consignment
and
just
not
know
what
it
is

may

the
best
bed-and-breakfast

have
ever
found
just
a
few
miles
away
at
the
Old
Vicarage
Higham
near

11. The
loveliest
to
my
mind
is
Melford
Hall
whose
charming
octagonal
Jacobean
gatehouse
is
reached
along
an
avenue
of
clipped
yew
trees
and
with
its
high
windows
flooding:1
the
octagon
with
light
is
my
fantasy
of
the
ideal
study

they
told
it
without
on-screen
questioning
though
the

skilfully
structured:1

have
lacked

requires

18. Wriggling:1
across
country
on
the
D216
to
Port-d'Envaux
you
come
to
two
more
chateaux
18th-century
Panloy
flaking:1
romantically:1
away
on
its
hillock
overlooking
a
bend
in
the
Charente
and
almost
next
door
the
much
older

half-smothered
in
amazing
flamboyant
Gothic

19. The
core
of
the
problem
is
simple

invited
to
New

planning

summer
