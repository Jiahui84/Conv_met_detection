Losing:1
was
one
thing
but
to
lose:1
as
spinelessly:1
as
the
Welsh
XV
did
to
Bridgend
on
Saturday
was
to
add
insult:1
to
severely
injured:1
pride

Others
are
not
so
well+informed

The
hero
Francis
Mayne
is
suffering:1
from
the
adolescent
emotional
confusion
and
acute
self-consciousness

So
of+course
does
alcohol
itself

From
MARC
CHAMPION
in
Washington

So
they
should
and
when
the
list
of
necessities
is
securely
written+down
you
can
ask
the
second
question
How
do
I
want
this
garden
to
feel

Pub
landlords
are
usually
only
too
happy:1
to
provide
free
accommodation

Other
British
towns
Croydon
and
Southampton
among
them
are
also
considering
modern
tramways

There
are
three
key:1
causes
of
the
shambles
Mr
Kenneth
Clarke
the
failure
to
separate
emergency
from
non-emergency
work
and
the
Whitley
Council
negotiating
machinery

The
Health
Secretary
accused
the
unions
of
posturing:1
and
pretending:1
to
run:1
a
999
service
yesterday

George
Graham
was
not
amused

He
was
awarded
honorary
degrees
by
Algiers
Glasgow
and
Oxford

Its
two
main
slogans
repeated
countless
times
in
the
directives
issued
by
the
underground
leadership
are
freedom
and
independence

Harsh
measures
putting
an
entire
community
under
an
absolute
curfew
for
a
continuous
lengthy
period
of
time
demolishing
homes
uprooting
olive
or
citrus
trees
physical
intimidation
and
terror
tactics
employed
by
raiding
army
units
shooting
killing
cutting+off
water+supplies
or
electricity
and
telephone
links
to
villages
or
towns
mass
arrests
intimidatory
interrogation
techniques
can
either
create
a
temporary
lull
or
activate
an
eruption

The
offices
of
R
and
B.
Lettings
are
now
up
for
sale

Not
a
sign
of
spring
had
yet
penetrated:1
this
secret
valley
but
another
month
would
put
that
right
