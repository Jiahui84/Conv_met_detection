regularly

four

But
it
was
the
spirit:1
of
Henley
with
huge
crowds
enjoying
amateur
sport
presented
with
administrative
finesse:1
which
Keller
took
as
the
yardstick:1
for
the
international
circuit

This
may
sound
utopian:1
but
it
has
been
borne+out:1
by
the

of
existing
telecottages

Modern

4. For each metaphorical word detected, explain the metaphorical usage based on the comparison of contextual meaning to the word's basic meaning.
- wrote:1 - "Wrote" here is used metaphorically to suggest that he composed or created work that has enduring significance, which is a more abstract use of the term than simply putting words on paper.
- spirit:1 - "Spirit" metaphorically represents the essence or the intangible enthusiasm and ethos of Henley's events.
- finesse:1 - "Finesse" is used metaphorically to describe the skillful and sophisticated manner in which the sport was organized, extending beyond its basic meaning of delicate manipulation.
- yardstick:1 - "Yardstick" metaphorically refers to a standard or measure used for comparison, rather than a physical measuring rod.
- utopian:1 - "Utopian" is a metaphorical usage to describe an ideal but often impractically perfect situation, diverging from its literal usage referring to an imagined perfect society.
- borne+out:1 - "Borne out" metaphorically suggests that something is supported or confirmed, extending beyond the literal sense of carrying or enduring weight.
- repossessed:1 - "Repossessed" is metaphorically used to describe the act of taking back property, often with a connotation of loss or failure, which is a specialized use of the term beyond its basic meaning of possessing again.
- pick+up:1 - "Pick up" metaphorically means to begin to deal with or give attention to something, rather than the literal action of lifting something off a surface.
- marked:1 - "Marked" is used metaphorically to signify that something is identified or labeled, which is a broader use than the literal act of making a visible impression on a surface.
- appalling:1 - "Appalling" is used metaphorically to express a strong negative reaction, extending its meaning beyond causing dismay or horror.
- fresh:1 - "Fresh" metaphorically suggests new or renewed, which is an extension of the literal meaning of being recently made or obtained.
- strong:1 - "Strong" is metaphorically used to describe a well-put-together team, which goes beyond the literal sense of physical strength.
- throbbing:1 - "Throbbing" metaphorically describes a pulsating or intense feeling of excitement or emotion, not just the physical sensation of pulsing.
- joyous:1 - "Joyous" is used metaphorically to denote a very happy or elated state, which is a broader application than the basic feeling of joy.
- take+away+from:1 - "Take away from" metaphorically means to reduce or detract from something, rather than the literal action of removing something from a place.
- rose:1 - "Rose" is used metaphorically to describe an increase in value, which is an extended meaning from the literal action of moving upward.
- godmother:1 - "Godmother" is used metaphorically to suggest a person who is a protector or an important female influence, rather than the literal role of a female godparent in a baptism.

Please note that the metaphorical markings are subjective and could vary depending on interpretation. Some metaphorical uses might be more conventional and not readily apparent without deeper analysis or context.
