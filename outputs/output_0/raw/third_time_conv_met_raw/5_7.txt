Given
the
already
appalling
and
growing
rate
of
homelessness
and
lack
of
hostel
facilities
in
London
when
more
people
than
ever
will
not
only
have
to
endure:1
the
freezing
nights
of
the
coming
winter
on
the
streets
but
perhaps
permanent
homelessness
it
was
terrible
to
see
the
situation
being
exploited
for
a
joke
by
your
advertisement
Just
the
thing
now
the
evenings
are
drawing+in

During
the
journey
East
German
officials
will
enter
the
train
and
collect
all
East
German
passports

Provided
their
behaviour
was
sportsmanlike
and
safe
oarsmen
found
only
encouragement
and
humour:1
from
a
President
who
was
always
among
them

Losing
was
one
thing
but
to
lose
as
spinelessly
as
the
Welsh
XV
did
to
Bridgend
on
Saturday
was
to
add
insult:1
to
severely
injured
pride

Others
are
not
so
well+informed

The
hero
Francis
Mayne
is
suffering
from
the
adolescent
emotional
confusion
and
acute
self-consciousness

So
of+course
does
alcohol
itself

From
MARC
CHAMPION
in
Washington

So
they
should
and
when
the
list
of
necessities
is
securely
written+down
you
can
ask
the
second
question
How
do
I
want
this
garden
to
feel

Pub
landlords
are
usually
only
too
happy
to
provide
free
accommodation

Other
British
towns
Croydon
and
Southampton
among
them
are
also
considering
modern
tramways

There
are
three
key
causes
of
the
shambles
Mr
Kenneth
Clarke
the
failure
to
separate
emergency
from
non-emergency
work
and
the
Whitley
Council
negotiating
machinery

The
Health
Secretary
accused
the
unions
of
posturing
and
pretending
to
run
a
999
service
yesterday

George
Graham
was
not
amused

He
was
awarded
honorary
degrees
by
Algiers
Glasgow
and
Oxford

Its
two
main
slogans
repeated
countless
times
in
the
directives
issued
by
the
underground
leadership
are
freedom
and
independence

Harsh
measures
putting
an
entire
community
under
an
absolute
curfew
for
a
continuous
lengthy
period
of
time
demolishing
homes
uprooting
olive
or
citrus
trees
physical
intimidation
and
terror:1
tactics
employed
by
raiding
army
units
shooting
killing
cutting+off
water+supplies
or
electricity
and
telephone
links
to
villages
or
towns
mass
arrests
intimidatory
interrogation
techniques
can
either
create
a
temporary
lull
or
activate:1
an
eruption

The
offices
of
R
and
B.
Lettings
are
now
up
for
sale

Not
a
sign
of
spring
had
yet
penetrated
this
secret
valley
but
another
month
would
put
that
right
