Note: Some words that are part of idiomatic expressions or fixed phrases are marked as metaphors (e.g., "pick up the file," "take away from," "rose" as in stock prices rising). However, not every metaphorical phrase has been identified with complete certainty, as context may influence whether a word or phrase is metaphorical.
