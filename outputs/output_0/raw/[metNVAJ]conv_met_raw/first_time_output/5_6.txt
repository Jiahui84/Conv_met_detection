error
in

preparation
of
his
£697m
break-up:1
bid
for
stationery
and
packaging
group
DRG

2. That
point
about
the
core
business
is
very
unfair:1
he

the

statistics
to
those
figures
does
not
improve:1
our
relative
position

4. For
many
years
Thomson
lived:1
in
New
York
in
his
apartment
at
the
Chelsea

the
Church
of
England

Iznik
pottery
from
Turkey
dating:1
from
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
explodes:1
with
colour
on
more
sophisticated:1
white
grounds
Iznik
is
now
highly
sought:1
after
by
Turkish
yuppies
and
prices
run:1
from
£2,000
or
so
to
£15,000

10. But
then
do
the
French
Spanish
or
Italians
have
a
word
for
it

11. The
summer
sprawl
begins
to
be
oppressive:1
at
this
stage
in
the
year
and
trigger
fingers
are
itching:1
to
snip+back
overgrown
mallows
clear+out
the
mildewing
foliage
of
golden
rod
and
reduce:1
the

it
will

probably
muttering:1
I
'm
too
busy
to
get
involved:1
in
this
sort
of
thing

18. OVERNIGHT
FILE

19. A
mile
above
the
shepherd
hut
the
hillsides
ceased
their
upward
rolling
and
curved
together
to
form
a
dead-end
valley
of
broad-breasted:1
slopes
five
miles
from
the
nearest

road
hidden
deep
in
the
folds
of
