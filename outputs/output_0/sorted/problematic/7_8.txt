Step 2: List every word in the given sentence sequentially, placing one word per row. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences. Then, review the words to confirm which are conventional metaphors. After confirmation, mark the words that are conventional metaphors with ':1' in the word lists.

Since there are many words, I will demonstrate this process with the first sentence and leave the rest to be carried out similarly.

1. It
2. does
3. not
4. matter
5. whether+or+not
6. DRG
7. makes
8. sellotape
9. or
10. Basildon
11. Bond
12. it
13. 's
14. of
15. no
16. consequence:1
17. to
18. anybody
19. if
20. somebody
21. else
22. makes
23. them

(Empty row to separate word lists from different sentences)

Please note that the rest of the sentences should be treated in the same way, with the words being listed and marked with ':1' where applicable.
