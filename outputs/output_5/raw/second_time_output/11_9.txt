1. If
he
had
taken
his
own
rule
seriously
he
would
have
found+out
that
DRG
has
a
very
modest
self-service
canteen
at
its
Bristol
head
office

2. From
MR

3. Labour
law
will
always
reflect:1
the
balance:1
of
power:1
in
society
and
a
fully+fledged
labour
court
system
will
not
remove
class
and
fundamental
employer-employee
differences

4. From
there
like
a
eyrie:1
its
in
buzzard
he
would
make
forays:1
round
the
US
and
abroad
in+spite+of
his
advanced
age

5. It
would
also
be
necessary
to
smash:1
the
decrepit:1
effete:1
constitution
that
allows
a
minority
to
capture:1
power
and
then
use
it
ruthlessly
in
the
interests
of
the
privileged
few

6. The
simple
answer
is
that
Chelsea
are
in
a
FALSE
position:1
and
Arsenal
on
this
evidence
slightly
jaded:1
champions

7. But
it
will
not
mean
that
we
are
abandoning
them

8. And
Richard
North
looks
at
current
provisions
for
the
destruction:1
of
PCBs
and
at
the
history
of
British
involvement
in
a
rather
uncomfortable:1
growth+industry:1
The
security+guard
at
the
entrance
to
one
of
Britain
mightiest
hazardous
waste
disposal
plants
pressed
a
button
and

10. In
1986
according+to
Friends
of
the
Earth
a
survey
of
the
homes
clustered
on
the
surrounding
hills
found
that
three-quarters
of
800
residents
were
opposed
to
the
Rechem
plant

11. Zinc
is
the
latest
lack
of
it
supposedly
causes
a
range
of
problems
although
little
scientific
evidence
supports
the
link

12. It
will
be
my

13. Completion
normally
takes
place
four
to
eight

second
thoughts

14. Of
the
two
prototype
rock
songwriters
it
's
the
more
worldly
Chuck
Berry
you
turn
to
for
the
authentic
picture
of
teenage
pleasures
in
Eisenhower
America
Gon
na
write
a
little
letter
Gon

my
local
deejay

15. Clapham
indeed
accounts
for
nearly
half
the
77
fatalities
of
the
last
ten
years
compare
that
with
the
5
deaths
and
300
injuries
every
year
on
the
roads

16. Yet
the
ambulance
worker
is
only
being
offered
ÃÂ£10,000
when
a
fire
officer
is
being
given
ÃÂ£13,000
and
a
Metropolitan
police
constable
can
earn
ÃÂ£25,000

18. Water
is
everywhere
canals
streams
small
busy
rivers
with
charming:1
names
like
the
Boutonne
the
Mignon
and
the
Belle
and
big
lazy:1
rivers
like
the
Sevre
Niortaise
and
the
Charente

19. Since
1986
Rytasha
has
broken+away+from
her
guru
and
set+up
on
her
own
with
a
charity
called
Food
Relief
International
which
raises
money
from
the
fiercely
competitive
matrons
of
Palm
Beach
and
distributes
it
to
the
starving
people
of
Bangladesh
