1. of

1. the

1. Socialist

1. Republic

1. of

1. Kennedy

1. a

1. Conservative+Party

1. member

1. who

1. relative

1. of

1. Nicholas

1. Another

1. response

1. to

1. a

1. visual

1. But

1. the

1. dying:1

1. becoming:1

1. suburbs

1. a

1. lorry-driver

1. has

1. more

1. idea

1. of

1. what

1. he

1. is

1. handling

1. than

1. a

1. docker

1. who

1. could

1. have

1. a

1. consignment

1. and

1. just

1. not

1. know

1. what

1. it

1. is

1. Dr

1. Slevin

1. agreed

1. that

1. this

1. is

1. often

1. beneficial
