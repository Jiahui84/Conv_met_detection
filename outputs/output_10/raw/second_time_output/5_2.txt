its
last
effort
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
set+up
by
Harold
Wilson
and
headed
by
George
Brown
ended
in:1
futile
departmental
and
ministerial
infighting

2. But
while
the
DTI
would
override
the
Treasury
a
new
powerful
Department
of
Consumer
Affairs
would
antagonise
the
DTI

3. Labour
would
be
acquiescing:1
in:1
a
democratic
outrage
if
it
continued
arguing
that
because
the
Conservatives
had
got
away
with:1
being
undemocratic
for
so
long
it
was
now
Labour
turn

4. While
telecottages
should
become
self-financing
once
established
they
do
need
initial
subsidy

5. Villages
are
expensive
to
live
in:1
and
if
they
are
to
become
vibrant
communities
again
local
people
must
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
be
able
to
continue
living
in:1
them

6. Mr
Smith
said
in:1
an
interview
on
BBC
television
's
On
the
Record
that
he
did
not
expect
his
colleagues
to
spend
and
spend
again'
when
they
took
office

7. Doctors
are
worried
that
women
turning

not
drink
because
we
are
thirsty

9. Globe
artichokes
are
sprouting

smooth:1
the
path:1
for
purchasers
and
streamline
the
system
says
Graham
Harrison
pointing+out
that
live
telephone
bidding
will
also
be
available
for
those
unable
to
attend

11. Although
collective
property
auctions
take
place
regularly
in:1
London
often
primarily
for
investors
rather+than
house-hunters
in:1
country
areas
the
more
typical
auction
will
be
just
for
one
house
and
as
likely
as
not
will
take
place
in:1
a
nearby
pub
or
village
hall

12. And
although
the
supertram
concept
will
spread
through
major
cities
during
the
next
decade
Blackpool
will
still
be
alone
in:1
its
use
of
traditional
double-deckers

13. Armstrong
seems
the
least
permanently
damaged
on
the
surface

14. Under:1
strain
for
a
start
because
it
was
technically
ill-equipped
to
avert:1
disaster
or
to
cope
with:1
the
consequences
when
disaster
struck
under:1
strain
from
commercial
pressures
which
as
the
inquiry
puts
it
compromised
safety
under:1
strain
above
all
because
the
people
on
the
spot
could
n't
or
would
n't
cope
were
weary
from
gruesome
working
hours
the
senior
signal
technician
who
heads
the
list
of
the
culpable
had
had
only
one
day
off
in:1
the
past
13
weeks
lacked
adequate
training
or
simply
could
n't
be
bothered

15. In:1
law
there
was
no
doubt
that
Mrs
Bujok
was
entitled
to
commence
proceedings
without
giving
notice
of
the
state
of
the
dwelling
to
the
council

16. He
took
it
on
the
chin:1

17. In:1
the
meantime
we
have
the
capacity
to
bring
coherence:1
and
organisation
to
a
whole
range
of
activities
further
consolidating
the
institutional
linkage
between
the
people
in:1
the
occupied

and
the
PLO

18. The
age
structure
of
Meadowell
means
it
is
awash
with:1
teenagers
whose
only
pastimes
are
having
babies
and
body-building

19. Like
the
heckler
he
was
a
Liberal
