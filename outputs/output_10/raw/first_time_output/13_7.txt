Please note that the identification of metaphors is subjective, and without a specific set of metaphorical uses to match against, it can be difficult to create a fully accurate list. The ':1' markers were added based on a general interpretation of conventional metaphors, and there may be some words that are metaphorical in specific contexts that aren't marked as such above.
