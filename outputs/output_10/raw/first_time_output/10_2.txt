departmental
and
ministerial
infighting

2. But
while
the
DTI
would
override:1

a
new
powerful
Department
of
Consumer
Affairs
would
antagonise:1
the
DTI

3. Labour
would
be
acquiescing:1
in:1
a
democratic
outrage
if
it
continued
arguing
that
because
the
Conservatives
had
got
away
with:1
being
undemocratic
for
so
long
it
was
now
Labour
turn

telecottages

expensive

to
become
vibrant

again
local

must
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
be
able
to
continue
living
in:1
them

6. Mr
Smith
said
in:1
an
interview
on
BBC
television
's
On
the
Record
that
he
did
not
expect
his
colleagues
to
spend
and
spend:1

bidding
will
also
be
available
for
those
unable
to
attend

11. Although
collective
property
auctions
take
place
regularly
in:1
London
often
primarily
for
investors
rather+than
house-hunters
in:1
country
areas
the
more
typical
auction
will
be
just
for
one
house

still
be
alone
in:1
its
use

13. Armstrong
seems
the
least
permanently
damaged

avert

cope
were
weary
from
gruesome
working

the
senior
signal

who
heads
the
list
of
the
culpable
had
had
only
one
day
off
in:1
the
past
13
weeks
lacked
adequate
training

further
consolidating
