1. The
figure
is
very
close:1
to
the
1.5C
temperature
target
set
by
countries
in
Paris
in
2015
although
the
global
temperature
would
need
to
be
consistently
above
1.5C
for
the
target
to
be
considered
broken

2. Scientists
at
the
EU
's
Copernicus
Climate
Change
Service
CCCS
said
it
was
likely
the
1.5C
mark
will
be
passed
for
the
first
time
in
the
next
12
months

3. The
average
temperature
in
2023
was
0.17C
higher
than
in
2016
the
previous
record
year
marking
a
very
large
increase
in
climate
terms

4. The
primary
cause
of
this
increased:1
global
heating
was
continued
record
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
assisted:1
by
the
return
of
the
natural
climate
phenomenon
