I
would
say
generally
that
the
majority
of
our
members
raised:1
their
prices
somewhere
between
10
and
15
percent
this:1
year
Santa
Arnold
says

In
part
these
increased
prices
compensate:1
Santas
for
the
rising:1
cost
of
doing
business
he
says
including
higher
fuel
costs
and
more
expensive
Santa
suits

But
they
also
reflect:1
the
reality
that
amidst
surging:1
demand
there
are
only
so
many
Santas
to
go:1
around

Call
it
