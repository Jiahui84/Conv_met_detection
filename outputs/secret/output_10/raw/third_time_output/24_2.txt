I've
traveled:1
the
country
this
last
year
going
to
Santa
schools
speaking
at
conventions
and
really
trying
to
connect:1
with
the
Santa
community
to
let
them
know
the
advantages
of
being
a
professional
Santa
as
well
as
working
with
Hire
Santa

Classic
economic
theory
suggests
that
if
there's
a
shortage
of
something
there's
a
simple
solution:
raise:1
the
price

In
this
case
that
means
raising
Santa's
wages
which
should
convince
more
people
to
grow
a
white
beard
and
don:1
a
red
suit
And
indeed
Arnold
says
many
Santas
are
earning
more
this
year
