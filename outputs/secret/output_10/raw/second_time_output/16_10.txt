Scientists

said
it
was
likely
the
1.5C
mark
will
be
passed
for
the
first
time
in
the
next
12
months

The
average
temperature
in
2023
was
0.17C
higher
than
in
2016
the
previous
record
year
marking
a
very
large
increase
in:1
climate
terms

The
primary
cause
of
this
increased
global
heating
was
continued
record
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
assisted
by
the
return
of
the
