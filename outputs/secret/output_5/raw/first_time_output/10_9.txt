2023
smashed:1
the
record
for
the
hottest
year
by
a
huge
margin
providing:1
dramatic
testimony:1
of:1
how
much
warmer
and
more
dangerous
today
's
climate
is
from
the
cooler
one
in
which
human
civilisation
developed

The
planet
was
1.48C
hotter
in
2023
compared:1
with
the
period
before
the
mass
burning
of
fossil
fuels
ignited:1
the
climate
crisis

The
figure
is
very
close
to
the
1.5C
temperature
target
set
by
countries
in
Paris
in
2015
although
the
global
temperature
would
need
to
be
consistently
above
1.5C
for
the
target
to
be
considered
broken
