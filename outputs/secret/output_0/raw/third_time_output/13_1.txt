Parsing sentences into words, while identifying conventional metaphors, can be subjective and depend on the context or cultural understanding. Based on the given sentences, I will parse the words and attempt to identify any words that might be used as metaphors. However, it's important to note that the identification of metaphors can be open to interpretation, and not all metaphors may be conventional or universally agreed upon.

In the above parsing, I have marked "North Pole" as a metaphor since it refers to a real location but is commonly associated with Santa Claus in a metaphorical sense, representing the magical and mythical aspects of the Christmas tradition. The other words are taken literally in the context of the sentences provided. There may be other metaphorical or idiomatic uses of words that I have not marked, as they require a deeper analysis of context and cultural connotations.
