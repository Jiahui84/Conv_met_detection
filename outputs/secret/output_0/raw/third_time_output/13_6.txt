Note: In the context of these sentences, the word "fuelling" could be seen as metaphoric, representing the idea of "powering" or "driving the increase" in a non-literal sense. However, since the metaphorical use of "fuelling" is quite normalized in discussions about contributing factors to events, it has not been marked with ':1'. If you would like a stricter interpretation where any potential metaphor is marked, please let me know.
