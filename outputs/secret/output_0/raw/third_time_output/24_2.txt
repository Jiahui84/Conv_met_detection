classic
economic:1
theory
suggests
that
if
there
's
a
shortage
of
something
there
's
a
simple
solution
raise
the
price

in
this
case
that
means
raising
santa
's
wages
which
should
convince
more
people
to
grow
a
white
beard
and
don
a
red
suit
and
indeed
arnold
says
many
santas
are
earning
more
this
year

i
would
say
generally
that
the
majority
of
our
members
raised
their
prices
somewhere
between
10
and
15
percent
this
year
