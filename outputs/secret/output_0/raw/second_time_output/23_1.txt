Inflation
has
reached
the
North
Pole
as
a
Santa
shortage
looms

Over
the
last
year
as
vaccines
and
COVID
treatments
have
become
more
available
and
society
has
gotten
closer
to
normal
both
Hire
Santa
and
the
International
Brotherhood
of
Real-Bearded
Santas
have
worked
to
rebuild
the
Santa
workforce

We
here
at
Hire
Santa
have
been
working
very
hard
to
replenish
the
number
of
Santas

says

I
've
traveled
the
country
this
last
year
going
to
Santa
schools
speaking
at
conventions
and
really
trying
to
connect
with
the
Santa
community
to
let
them
know
the
advantages
of
being
a
professional
Santa
as
well
as
working
with
Hire
