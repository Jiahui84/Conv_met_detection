Artificial
intelligence
combined
with
wars
in
Ukraine
and
the
Middle
East
is
fuelling:1
a
boom:1
in
fraud
on
dating
and
social
media
apps
officials
at
Europol
have
said

Speaking
to
the
Guardian
the
agency
's
top
financial
crime
experts
said
scripts
generated
by
artificial
intelligence
enable
criminals
to
target
multiple
victims
at
once

Sebastian
Bley
the
head:1
of
the
Europol
economic
crime
team
in
The
Hague
saidThere
is
a
trend
of
more
and
more
cases
of
people
saying
I
'm
a
doctor
in
a
war
zone
and
asking
for
funds
to
be
transferred
out
of
that
zone

They
say
they
also
need
to
get
the
family
out

Burkhard
Mühl
the
overall
head:1
of
the
financial
and
economic
crime
unit
at
Europol
saidIt
can
involve
tens
of
thousands
of
euros
in
one
case

They
also
warned
of
a
rise
in
bogus
boss
scams
with
fraudsters
spinning:1
an
elaborate
web:1
of
fake
websites
fake
CVs
and
investor
profiles
to
target
a
gamut
of
victims
ranging
from
personal
investors
to
tax
authorities

The
impact
can
be
devastating
resulting
in
the
loss
of
life
savings
and
in
some
cases
suicide

2023
smashes:1
record
for
world
's
hottest
year
by
huge
margin

Rapid
reduction
in
fossil
fuel
burning
urgently
needed
to
preserve
liveable
conditions
say
scientists
as
climate
damage
deepens

2023
smashed:1
the
record
for
the
hottest
year
by
a
huge
margin
providing
dramatic
testimony:1
of
how
much
warmer
and
more
dangerous
today
's
climate
is
from
the
cooler
one
in
which
human
civilisation
developed

The
planet
was
1.48C
hotter
in
2023
compared
with
the
period
before
the
mass
burning
of
fossil
fuels
ignited:1
the
climate
crisis

The
figure
is
very
close
to
the
1.5C
temperature
target
set
by
countries
in
Paris
in
2015
although
the
global
temperature
would
need
to
be
consistently
above
1.5C
for
the
target
to
be
considered
broken

Scientists
at
the
EU
's
Copernicus
Climate
Change
Service
CCCS
said
it
was
likely
the
1.5C
mark
will
be
passed
for
the
first
time
in
the
next
12
months

The
average
temperature
in
2023
was
0.17C
higher
than
in
2016
the
previous
record
year
marking
a
very
large
increase
in
climate
terms

The
primary
cause
of
this
increased
global
heating
was
continued
record
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
assisted
by
the
return
of
the
natural
climate
phenomenon
El
Niño
