smashed:1
the

for
the

by
a

testimony:1
of
how
much
warmer:1
and
more
dangerous
today's
climate
is
from
the
cooler
one
in
which
human
civilisation
developed

The
planet
was
1.48C

in

compared
with
the
period
before
the

The
figure
is
very
close
to
the
1.5C
temperature
target
set
by
countries
in
Paris
in
2015
although
the
global
temperature
would
need
to
be
consistently
above
1.5C
for
the
target
to
be
considered
broken
