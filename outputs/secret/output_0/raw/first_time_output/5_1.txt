Inflation:1
has
reached
the
North
Pole
as
a
Santa
shortage
looms

Over
the
last
year
as
vaccines
and
COVID
treatments
have
become
more
available
and
society
has
gotten
closer
to
normal
both
Hire
Santa
and
the
International
Brotherhood
of
Real-Bearded
Santas
have
worked
to
rebuild
the
Santa
workforce

We
here
at
Hire
Santa
have
been
working
very
hard
to
replenish
the
number
of
Santas
Allen
says

I
've
traveled
the
country
this
last
year
going
to
Santa
schools
speaking
at
conventions
and
really
trying
to
connect
with
the
Santa
community
to
let
them
know
the
advantages
of
being
a
professional
Santa
as
well
as
working
with
Hire
Santa

Classic
economic
theory
suggests
that
if
there
's
a
shortage
of
something
there
's
a
simple
solution:
raise
the
price

In
this
case
that
means
raising
Santa
's
wages
which
should
convince
more
people
to
grow
a
white
beard
and
don
a
red
suit
And
indeed
Arnold
says
many
Santas
are
earning
more
this
year

I
would
say
generally
that
the
majority
of
our
members
raised
their
prices
somewhere
between
10
and
15
percent
this
year
Santa
Arnold
says

In
part
these
increased
prices
compensate
Santas
for
the
rising
cost
of
doing
business
he
says
including
higher
fuel
costs
and
more
expensive
Santa
suits

But
they
also
reflect
the
reality
that
amidst
surging
demand
there
are
only
so
many
Santas
to
go
around

Iranian
protesters
call
for
three-day
strike
as
pressure
on
regime
builds

State
media
distance
themselves
from
claim
morality
police
have
been
shut
down
after
Mahsa
Amini
death

Protesters
inÂ
IranÂ
have
called
for
a
three-day
strike
this
week
amid
conflicting
reports
that
the
nation
's
morality
police
had
been
shut
down
and
as
the
US
said
the
leadership
in
Tehran
had
locked
itself
into
a
vicious
cycle:1
that
had
cut
it
off
from
its
own
people
and
the
international
community

The
call
steps
up
pressure
on
Iranian
authorities
after
the
attorney
general
said
this
weekend
that
the
morality
police
whose
detention
of
a
young
woman
triggered
months
of
protests
had
been
shut
down

There
was
no
confirmation
of
the
closure
from
the
interior
ministry
which
is
in
charge
of
the
morality
police
and
Iranian
state
media
said
the
attorney
general
Mohammad
Jafar
Montazeri
was
not
responsible
for
overseeing
the
force

On
Sunday
after
a
closed
meeting
with
several
senior
Iranian
officials
including
President
Ebrahim
Raisi
lawmaker
Nezamoddin
Mousavi
told
semi-official
news
agency
Isna
that
the
government
was
paying
attention
to
the
people
's
real
demands
though
he
did
not
address
the
reported
closure
of
the
morality
police

Hundreds
of
people
have
been
killed
in
the
unrest
that
erupted
in
September
after
the
death
in
custody
of
Mahsa
Amini
a
22-year-old
Kurdish
Iranian
woman
who
was
detained
by
the
morality
police
for
breaking
