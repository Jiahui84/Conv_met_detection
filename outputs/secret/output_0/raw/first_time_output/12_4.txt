Protesters
in
Iran
have
called
for
a
three-day
strike
this
week
amid
conflicting
reports
that
the
nation:1
's
morality
police
had
been
shut
down
and
as
the
US
said
the
leadership
in
Tehran
had
locked
itself
into
a
vicious:1
cycle:1
that
had
cut
it
off
from
its
own
people
and
the
international
community

The
call
steps
up
pressure
on
Iranian
authorities
after
the
attorney
general
said
this
weekend
that
the

police
whose
detention
of

months
of
protests
had
