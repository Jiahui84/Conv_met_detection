Classic
economic
theory
suggests:1
that
if
there
's
a
shortage:1
of
something
there
's
a
simple
solution:1
raise
the
price

In
this
case
that
means:1
raising
Santa
's
wages
which
should
convince:1
more
people
to
grow
a
white
beard
and
don
a
red
suit
And
indeed
Arnold
says
many
Santas
are
earning:1
more
this
year

I
would
say
generally
that
the
majority
of
our
members
raised
their
prices
somewhere
between
10
and
15
percent
this
year
