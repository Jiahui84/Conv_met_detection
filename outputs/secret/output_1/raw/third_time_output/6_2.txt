1. Classic:1
economic
theory
suggests
that
if
there
's
a
shortage
of
something
there
's
a
simple
solution:
raise:1
the
price

2. In
this
case
that
means
raising:1
Santa
's
wages
which
should
convince
more
people
to
grow
a
white
beard
and
don
a
red
suit
And
indeed
Arnold
says
many
Santas
are
earning
more
this
year

3. I
would
say
generally
that
the
majority
of
our
members
raised
their
prices
somewhere
between
10
and
15
percent
this
year
