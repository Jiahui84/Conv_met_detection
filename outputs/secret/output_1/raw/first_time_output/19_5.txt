In sentence 1, "There" can be considered a metaphor for referring to a particular point or matter in a discussion or text. "Is" and "in charge" are part of a metaphorical phrase indicating responsibility or control over something, as if it were a physical space someone could be in.

In sentence 2, "Paying" and "attention" are part of the metaphorical phrase "paying attention," which suggests treating attention as a kind of currency one can pay. "People" here is also metaphorically used to represent the collective desires or interests of a population.

In sentence 3, the word "erupted" is used metaphorically to describe the sudden outbreak of unrest as if it were a volcano erupting.
