1. Explanation:

1. "Inflation" is a conventional metaphor for the general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money. "Reached" is metaphorically used to suggest that inflation has 'arrived' at a particular level, like a tangible object. "Looms" is a metaphor suggesting an impending negative event hanging over like a physical loom.

1. "Worked" can have a metaphorical usage to indicate effort towards achieving something, but in this context, it's closer to the literal meaning of performing tasks or duties. "Rebuild" is used metaphorically to suggest restoring the number of people in a workforce, similar to how one would rebuild a physical structure.

1. "Working" is metaphorically used to indicate effort towards a goal, not physical labor. "Replenish" is metaphorically used to suggest restoring a supply, like refilling a physical container.

1. "Connect" is a conventional metaphor used to describe the establishment of a relationship or communication between people, not the physical act of connecting objects. "Working" is used metaphorically as it refers to performing tasks or duties, similar to the previous sentences.
