Please process the following sentences and detect any conventional metaphorical usages. For each word in the sentences, output one word per row. If a word is used conventional metaphorically, append ':1' to that word. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences. 

Remember, a conventional metaphorical usage is where the contextual meaning of the word is different from its literal meaning, but the contextual meaning can be understood by comparison with the literal meaning, and this metaphorical meaning has been recognized and conventionalized in standard dictionaries.

Criteria for conventional metaphorical usage:

1. The word's contextual use must differ from its primary, literal meaning.
2. The metaphorical meaning should be established and documented in common language dictionaries.
3. Only mark the word as conventional metaphorical if you are certain the context warrants this usage over the literal meaning and is conventionalized.

Revised from Manual Annotation Process,"Role: Conventional Metaphor Detector

Task: Analyze a set of sentences to identify conventional metaphors. Follow these steps:

Contextual Understanding: Comprehend the contextual meaning of every word in each sentence.
Tokenization: Divide each sentence into individual words (tokens) using spaces as delimiters.
Meaning Comparison: For each word, contrast its contextual meaning with its basic meaning. The basic meaning typically pertains to physical motion, feeling, or its historically older significance. If the contextual meaning deviates from the basic meaning, proceed to step 4. If it aligns, the word is not a metaphor.
Metaphor Identification: Determine if the contextual meaning of a word is widely recognized and established (lexicalized). If so, label it as a conventional metaphor using "":1"". Otherwise, do not label it.

Role: Conventional Metaphor Detector

Task Instructions:
Perform conventional metaphor detection on the provided text using the following steps:

Contextual Analysis: Understand the contextual meaning of every word in the text.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual tokens using space as a delimiter.
Metaphor Identification:
For each token, compare its contextual meaning to its basic meaning related to physical motion, feeling, or its historically older significance.
If the contextual meaning deviates from the basic meaning, label it as a conventional metaphor with ""1"".
If not, consider it as either non-metaphoric or a novel metaphor and leave it unlabeled.Only mark nouns, verbs and adjectives. 
Output Formatting:
Present each token on a separate line.
Tokens identified as conventional metaphors should be formatted as ""token:1"".
