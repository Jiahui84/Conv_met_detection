"Task: Detect Conventional Metaphorical Usage in Sentences

Please process the following sentences and detect any conventional metaphorical usages. For each word in the sentences, output one word per row. If a word is used conventional metaphorically, append ':1' to that word. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences. 

Remember, a conventional metaphorical usage is where the contextual meaning of the word is different from its literal meaning, but the contextual meaning can be understood by comparison with the literal meaning, and this metaphorical meaning has been recognized and conventionalized in standard dictionaries.

Criteria for conventional metaphorical usage:

1. The word's contextual use must differ from its primary, literal meaning.
2. The metaphorical meaning should be established and documented in common language dictionaries.
3. Only mark the word as conventional metaphorical if you are certain the context warrants this usage over the literal meaning and is conventionalized.

"Contextual Understanding
Metaphors are a key element of language, allowing us to convey complex ideas and emotions in a relatable way. A conventional metaphor is a figure of speech that is well established, widely recognized, and commonly used in everyday language.

Metaphor detection Task
Now, list each word individually in each following sentences and annotate those which are used as conventional metaphors with ':1'. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences. Consider the broader context and the commonality of the metaphorical expression in everyday language.

Input sentences: {text}

Remember to evaluate each word within the context it is used in. Some words might typically be metaphorical but can be literal in certain contexts, and vice versa.

Labels: {label}",manual+ChatGPT4
"Context: Metaphors are figures of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it's not literally applicable. Conventional metaphors are of high frequency in daily usage and the meanings have been lexicalized in dictionary senses. 

Guidelines:

Pay close attention to words that represent one thing in terms of another.
Focus on widely recognized and used metaphors.
Only mark words that are explicitly metaphorical in the given context.

Based on the guidelines, process the following sentences. List every word from each sentence, one word per row, and mark conventional metaphorical words with ':1'. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences.

"Objective: detect conventional metaphors within the provided sentences by considering the context and overall message. Analyze each sentence to differentiate between literal language and metaphorical usage.

Criteria for Conventional Metaphors:

1. The metaphorical usage must be of high frequency and commonly understood.
2. It should be conventional, meaning it's recognized in dictionaries with its metaphorical meaning.

Instructions:

1. Read each input sentence thoroughly to understand its context and intent.
2. Detect words or phrases used metaphorically.
3. Check if these metaphorical uses are common and listed in dictionary entries as such.
4. Compile a list of all the words from each sentence.
5. Mark each conventional metaphor with ':1'.

Output:
Provide a list of all the words of each input sentences, one word per row, with conventional metaphorical words marked with ':1'. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences.

2. Apply the metaphor detection procedure to each input sentence:
   a. Read the input sentence thoroughly to establish a general understanding of its thematic content.
   b. detect all the lexical units (words and phrases) within the input sentence.
   c. For each lexical unit, perform the following:
      i. Determine its contextual meaning within the input sentence.
      ii. Confirm if this meaning is documented in standard dictionaries.
      iii. Compare the contextual meaning to the lexical unit's basic meaning in more common usage.
      iv. If the lexical unit has a metaphorical use that can be understood from its basic meaning, even though there is a contrast, mark it as conventioanl metaphorical.
3. Output every word of the input sentences sequentially, one word per row. For each conventional metaphorical word detected, append ':1' to signify its conventional metaphorical usage. Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences.

"Role: Conventional Metaphor Detector

Task: Analyze a set of sentences to detect conventional metaphors. Follow these steps:

Contextual Understanding: Comprehend the contextual meaning of every word in each sentence.
Tokenization: Divide each sentence into individual words (tokens) using spaces as delimiters.
Meaning Comparison: For each word, contrast its contextual meaning with its basic meaning. The basic meaning typically pertains to physical motion, feeling, or its historically older significance. If the contextual meaning deviates from the basic meaning, proceed to step 4. If it aligns, the word is not a metaphor.
Metaphor Detection: Determine if the contextual meaning of a word is widely recognized and established (lexicalized). If so, label it as a conventional metaphor using "":1"". Otherwise, do not label it.
Presentation: List each word of each input sentence on a separate row, one word per row. Separate words from different sentences with a blank row.

Guidelines:

Check: Determine if there is a difference between the literal and contextual meanings of the words.
Confirm: Verify if the metaphorical meaning is recognized in dictionaries.
Detect: If confirmed, the word is considered a conventional metaphor.

Process:

Read: Comprehend the message of each input sentence.
Find: Search for words that are used metaphorically in each input sentence.
Check: Consult a dictionary to confirm the conventional metaphorical use.
List: Enumerate all words from each sentence.
Mark: Append ':1' to any conventional metaphorical word.

Role: Conventional Metaphor Detector

Task Instructions:
Perform conventional metaphor detection on a set of sentences using the following steps:

Contextual Analysis: Understand the contextual meaning of every word in each sentence.
Tokenization: Split each sentence into individual tokens using space as a delimiter.
Metaphor detection:
For each token, compare its contextual meaning to its basic meaning related to physical motion, feeling, or its historically older significance.
If the contextual meaning deviates from the basic meaning, label it as a conventional metaphor with ""1"".
If not, consider it as either non-metaphoric or a novel metaphor and leave it unlabelled.
Output Formatting:
Output every token from each sentence.
Present each token on a separate row.
Use an empty row to separate word lists from different sentences. 
Tokens detected as conventional metaphors should be formatted as ""token:1"".
