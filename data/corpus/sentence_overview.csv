a1e-fragment01_2,By FRANK KANE,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_3,IT SEEMS that Roland Franklin the latest unbundler to appear in the UK has made a fatal error in the preparation of his £697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group DRG,FALSE,train,,6
a1e-fragment01_4,He has not properly investigated the target dining facilities,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_5,The 63-year-old head of Pembridge Investments through which the bid is being mounted says rule number one in this business is the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters the more inefficient the business,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_6,If he had taken his own rule seriously he would have found+out that DRG has a very modest self-service canteen at its Bristol head office,FALSE,train,,9
a1e-fragment01_7,There are other things he has on his own admission not fully investigated like the value of the DRG properties or which part of the DRG business he would keep after the break+up,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_8,When the bid was launched last week Mr Franklin faced some criticism from City commentators on both those counts,FALSE,test,,

a1e-fragment01_13,If they can prove it is there we might pay for it,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_14,On the other criticism he is equally dismissive,FALSE,test,,

a1e-fragment01_19,Mr Franklin went there at the end of the 1970s after the collapse of Keyser Ullman the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the Bank of England,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_20,He feels that Keyser problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition,FALSE,test,,
a1e-fragment01_21,He went to the US because Goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the UK and France were not the places to be,FALSE,test,,

a1f-fragment07_9,These reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 Education Act provision for compulsory part- or full-time education or training up+to the age of 18,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment07_10,This clause has never yet been activated,TRUE,test,,
a1f-fragment07_11,The sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away+from education and into unskilled or semi-skilled jobs,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment07_12,Employers must be required to release 16-18-year-olds for education and training for at+least two days per week,FALSE,test,,

a1f-fragment08_5,All it needs is to promise a high-powered investigation such+as a Royal Commission into the practicalities of an alternative voting system surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment08_6,Such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for Mr Kinnock,FALSE,test,,

a1f-fragment09_3,From MR DENIS MacSHANE,FALSE,train,,9
a1f-fragment09_4,Sir If Labour is to suggest the setting+up of a specialist labour court 30 September then such a momentous change in the industrial relations system deserves more discussion and needs to be taken out+of the hot-house of Labour+Party conference politics,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment09_5,For three reasons such a move should be welcomed,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment09_6,First it would bring Britain into+line+with the best European practice notably in Germany where local regional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fair dispassionate way based on law precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment09_7,Second it would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunities,FALSE,test,,
a1f-fragment09_8,Labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society and a fully+fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental employer-employee differences,FALSE,train,,9

a36-fragment07_3,By MARTIN PACEY,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_4,IT WAS unfair of Auden to suggest in his Letter to Lord Byron that a poet sense of other people 's very hazy,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_5,But the vaporous presences that float through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claim,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_6,The book which opens a projected sequence of novels that will cover the period from 1968 to the present day aims to explore what the blurb describes as the painful transition from youth to adulthood,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_7,This of+course is a popular subject it seems particularly attractive to the poet-turned-novelist because+of the scope it offers for the tremulously sensitive probing of feelings,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_8,Sensitivity though is not enough,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_9,What Andrew Motion presents us with here is a static and humourless mood-piece filled with over-elaborate imagery,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_10,The hero Francis Mayne is suffering from the adolescent emotional confusion and acute self-consciousness,FALSE,train,,7
a36-fragment07_11,He finds it hard to communicate with people not least his separated parents,FALSE,test,,

a36-fragment07_14,The first half of the novel is dominated by the girl death from leukaemia,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_15,There is a refreshing simplicity and tenderness in Motion account of the way Francis nurses her but she herself is too sketchily drawn for the episode to carry much weight,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_16,Meanwhile at his public+school Francis is conducting a love-affair with an older pupil named Keith Ogilvie,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_17,He is finally rejected by the devious arrogant Keith who informs him that he is obsolete because he does not know how to make things happen,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_18,His response to this rejection is as flat as his reaction to the massive demonstration which Keith has earlier persuaded him to join against the Vietnam War,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_19,This violent event described at+length in hysterically colourful terms is the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plot,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_20,Other broad hints as+to the date are inserted with a comical lack of subtlety My God darling have you heard exclaims Francis mother one day as she greets him Czechoslovakia,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_21,It 's been invaded,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_22,Motion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture the feel of a period,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_23,But the book principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_24,In his eagerness to depict the cloudy psychology of an adolescent Motion has forgotten to give the boy a personality,TRUE,test,,
a36-fragment07_25,He has however given him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_26,Hardly a page goes+by without the hapless Francis noticing something which reminds him improbably of something else,FALSE,test,,
a36-fragment07_27,Sometimes he is reminded of several things,FALSE,train,,6

a38-fragment01_4,FROM this month all new cars submitted for British type approval the test which allows them to be legally sold in the UK must be able to run on lead-free petrol,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_5,As a result of this rule and many carefully orchestrated publicity campaigns the motor industry image has now changed from polluter to pal of the earth,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_6,If you can afford an environmentally friendly G-registered runabout then the flora fauna and children of the British Isles will have a lot to thank you for,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_7,But if you have a tight budget and a conscience running older cars on lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated issue,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_8,Without the presence of a lead compound an engine valve seats go unprotected,TRUE,test,,
a38-fragment01_9,This leads to premature wear and plumes of blue smoke spewing from the exhaust,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_10,The only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seats or a replacement cylinder head both expensive options,TRUE,test,,
a38-fragment01_11,Less costly but not entirely satisfactory is the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrol which protects the valve seats but rather defeats the object,TRUE,test,,
a38-fragment01_12,Alternatively there are several chemical additives on the market which aim to provide a substitute for lead although the case for these products has yet to be proved,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_13,However many cars built within the last few years have hardened valve seats or alloy cylinder heads that need little simply a retune or no modification to use unleaded petrol,TRUE,test,,
a38-fragment01_14,Finding+out which cars can and which can not is not difficult,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_15,Esso filling+stations have a free booklet listing most models produced since 1980 as does the charity Clear 01-387 4970 with more detail available in the Unleaded Petrol Guide Autodale £2.99,FALSE,test,,

a38-fragment01_21,In years to come the percentage difference is likely to be much larger,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_22,Even+so exotica such+as lead-only Porsche 911s and Ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend so no bargains there I 'm afraid,FALSE,test,,

a38-fragment01_26,If the greenness of going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey area it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubt,TRUE,test,,
a38-fragment01_27,Diesel always has been lead-free and the only adjustments you need to make are mental ones because diesel-powered cars are no+longer slow smelly or noisy,TRUE,test,,
a38-fragment01_28,They also return more miles to the gallon than their petrol equivalents although service intervals are shorter,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_29,But after the publicity on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in used diesel power,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_30,"But remember that these cars accrue and can withstand significantly higher mileages than petrol cars 50-90,000 being the norm",FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_31,The tradition for diesel cars is far better established on the Continent and that is where the best buys come from,FALSE,test,,
a38-fragment01_32,"Perhaps the most successful maker is Peugeot with a complete range of cars from the small 205 around £3,000 for a 90,000-mile 1985 car to the legendary 504 =estate about £2,000 for a 1982 example",FALSE,test,,

a3k-fragment11_5,IN THE small Devon town of South Molton Julie Widlake is waiting with anticipation for Friday 20 October,FALSE,train,,5
a3k-fragment11_6,She and her boyfriend have had their future planned for some time they want to start farming in a nearby village where they also intend to build a bungalow,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_7,First they have to sell their present house a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town,FALSE,train,,1
a3k-fragment11_8,As is the case almost everywhere else the market in Devon is depressed and selling has not been easy,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_9,So instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer they have decided to try selling their house by auction,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_10,It comes under the hammer at 2.15pm on the 20th at the Barnstaple Motel,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_11,We accept that we might not get very much for it but on the other hand we could get more says Julie Widlake,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_12,We 've been waiting to move for a long time and we need the money to build the new house,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_13,"Their South Molton cottage guide price £44,000-£46,000 is one of more+than 20 lots to be put+up for sale at the Barnstaple auction by Bristol and West Property Services and one of more+than a hundred which the building+society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight West+Country venues over a three-day period",FALSE,train,,1
a3k-fragment11_14,Bristol and West claims these auctions will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow market and says it was overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this way,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_15,Auctions certainly speed+up the house-buying process,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_16,Once the hammer has fallen the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_17,Completion normally takes place four to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts,FALSE,train,,9
a3k-fragment11_18,As the Bristol and West explains if a bidder does not sign the contract the auctioneer can sign on their behalf,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_19,From the vendor point of view the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made says Graham Harrison director of Bristol and West Property Services,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_20,Many people have suffered from sales falling+through and from house-buying chains and some of our vendors feel that now 's as good a time as any to sell,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_21,From the purchasers point of view auctions can also be attractive if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreams,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_22,The problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage finance without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling+price,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_23,Not surprisingly several estate+agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting enough serious bidders,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_24,With an auction you 've got to be certain that at+least two buyers are there who can commit themselves and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far between said David Phillip a director of Yorkshire estate+agents Dacre Son and Hartley,FALSE,train,,1
a3k-fragment11_25,Bristol and West hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problem,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_26,It is also guaranteeing mortgages at 1 per+cent below the normal interest+rate for endowment or pension-linked policies on several of the houses up for sale an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders mortgage surveys will already have been undertaken for these houses,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_27,The building+society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auction and says buyers could arrange finance there and then subject of+course to proof of income and status,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_28,Obviously however Bristol and West hopes to hear from interested people in advance if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction starts,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_29,We 're trying to smooth the path for purchasers and streamline the system says Graham Harrison pointing+out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend,FALSE,train,,2
a3k-fragment11_30,Holiday+homes and commercial property have been included among the lots to be auctioned,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_31,Although collective property auctions take place regularly in London often primarily for investors rather+than house-hunters in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house and as likely as not will take place in a nearby pub or village hall,FALSE,train,,2
a3k-fragment11_32,In fact country auctions are often the nearest many villages get to live theatre,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_33,The locals come for the entertainment and to see who 's buying into their village observed one auction-goer,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_34,Pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free accommodation,FALSE,train,,7
a3k-fragment11_35,It 's very exciting and gets the adrenalin going says David Phillip whose firm usually undertakes auctions in the Otley area,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_36,Only certain types of property normally come to auction however,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_37,Traditionally country cottages and houses which have unusual or unique features or are in+need+of a lot of renovation may be auctioned if only because valuation is likely to be difficult,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_38,Sometimes too houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market value and protect trustees from future claims of negligence,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_39,Less happily but for the same reason repossessed houses are often auctioned,FALSE,train,,10
a3k-fragment11_40,Anyone considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higher,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_41,Advertising costs and any expenses incurred in hiring premises are normally passed+on by the estate+agents to the vendor whether+or+not the auction results in a sale,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_42,In+addition agents may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful sale,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_43,In Bristol and West forthcoming auctions a set fee of £375 plus VAT will be charged to everyone entering property to sell with its usual agent commission about 2 per+cent plus VAT charged on top when sales are made,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_44,We accept that we could lose the money we 've paid to go to auction but that 's a risk we 're prepared to take says Julie Widlake,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_45,The secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve+price a task the auctioneer undertakes in+conjunction+with the seller,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_46,Normally the reserve is set only days or hours before the auction when the agents will already have a good indication of how much interest has been shown,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_47,Too high a reserve+price can mean no sale and disappointment all round,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_48,You need to understand what your clients expectations are beforehand says Graham Harrison of Bristol and West,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_49,Agents and their clients may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made prior+to the auction,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_50,Inevitably they do not always get it right,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_51,Peter Crowther managing director of a Leeds business centre recently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in Bramhope on the outskirts of Leeds at an auction in the village pub,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_52,"His successful bid was for £190,000 although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned+down",FALSE,train,,5
a3k-fragment11_53,On the other hand sometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidders can have the opposite effect,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_54,"Another recent auction in Leeds saw a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall under the hammer for £330,500",FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_55,Success is by+no+means guaranteed at auction says Graham Harrison,FALSE,test,,
a3k-fragment11_56,In a tough market you need to get the programme right the price right and have a little bit of luck,FALSE,test,,

a3m-fragment02_4,MODERN trams as most continental Europeans know neither shake nor rattle nor do they roll,FALSE,train,example,
a3m-fragment02_5,Sleek solidly built gentle on the environment they are often an ideal form of city transport,TRUE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_6,They also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_7,Single-car articulated or double-decker trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport invented,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_8,The orange-liveried 1500 series trams in Milan for+example date from 1927,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_9,Eventually they will be replaced but more+than 60 years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a Swiss watch,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_10,They are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore Emmanuele,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_11,Last month it was announced that Britain will get its first new-wave trams in 1991,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_12,Destined to run in Manchester they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre outlying suburbs and satellite towns of Bury Altrincham Salford Oldham and Rochdale,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_13,In Britain with the main exception of Blackpool not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno trams had been largely relegated to the history books,FALSE,train,,5
a3m-fragment02_14,Otherwise the best place to see working trams has been the tram museum at Crich in Derbyshire or else in old British Transport Commission films and Ealing comedies,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_15,Trams disappeared from most British cities in the 1950s,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_16,London venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time in 1952,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_17,Somehow the image of the tall thin mournful double-deck tram with its wooden body slatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the British mind,TRUE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_18,Trams it was believed until surprisingly recently are old-fashioned,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_19,They had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper men in hats National Health specs smog and powdered egg,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_20,They held+up the bright new diesel buses and even worse blocked the progress of private motorists in bulbous Austins and lumpen Humbers in canyon-like city thoroughfares,TRUE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_21,They picked+up power from a spider+'s+web of unsightly overhead wires,TRUE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_22,They were inflexible in operation draughty and mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled Do Not Spit signs screwed to their bulkheads,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_23,But the modern tram could hardly be more different,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_24,It plays a key role in keeping city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers desire,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_25,In Milan for+example the commission to design the new generation of Jumbo trams which went into service in 1979 was one that leading Italian architects and designers fought over,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_26,After all the Jumbo a handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect engineer and critic Klaus Giovanni Koenig will be seen on the streets of Milan for the next half-century,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_27,Spotlessly clean and popular the Jumbo is a long-term advertisement for Koenig design skills,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_28,The modern tram is a green machine,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_29,Assuming the power+station at the end of the line burns cleanly the tram is virtually pollution free,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_30,Standing at traffic+lights a Koenig-designed Jumbo is save+for the chatter inside completely silent,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_31,The overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see them,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_32,Powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable the latter far greater than any car,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_33,But sadly there is no indication that the GMA consortium which will design operate and maintain the first of the new generation British trams in Manchester will share the looks of their Milanese counterparts,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_34,Artists impressions show a tram that has more in+common+with the flat-faced characterless light trains of the toy-like Docklands Light Railway,TRUE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_35,There is still time for GMA GEC Mowlem Amec and Greater Manchester Buses to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_36,After all Mancunians and visitors to the Manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes for well into the twenty-first century,TRUE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_37,Now+that buses are no+longer designed to enhance the streets they serve Manchester has a chance to make a fresh start with its trams,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_38,Manchester is not alone,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_39,Other British towns Croydon and Southampton among them are also considering modern tramways,FALSE,train,,7
a3m-fragment02_40,These are all referred to as supertram networks the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessors,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_41,What it really means is that the new trams are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban train,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_42,Although they will slip through the city centre serving the essential parts shopping malls leisure+centres theme parks amusement arcades and museums the Manchester supertrams will also head out+of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway+lines,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_43,The supertram is in effect a low-cost replacement for British Rail ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains those rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spotters,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_44,They will perform some of the same functions but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams,FALSE,test,,
a3m-fragment02_1,And although the supertram concept will spread through major cities during the next decade Blackpool will still be alone in its use of traditional double-deckers,FALSE,train,,2

a3p-fragment09_15,The hotel lies in five acres of fields and garden and the Slingos who own it make the most of their beautiful surroundings by running painting courses for about £200 a week including breakfast and dinner or £90 for a long weekend,FALSE,train,example,
a3p-fragment09_16,These are so popular that you will need to book at+least a couple of months in advance,FALSE,test,,

a3p-fragment09_33,There are several splendid houses near Long Melford that would make for a gentle afternoon potter through the rooms and possessions of the rich of a few centuries ago,FALSE,test,,
a3p-fragment09_34,The loveliest to my mind is Melford Hall whose charming octagonal Jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew trees and with its high windows flooding the octagon with light is my fantasy of the ideal study,FALSE,train,,4

a4d-fragment02_2,A prayer for the brick cathedral facing St Paul Bankside Power+Station is a masterpiece worth preserving Gavin Stamp argues,TRUE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_3,By GAVIN STAMP,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_4,FROM the top of the dome of St Paul Cathedral the view is no+longer dominated by City church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony of drab characterless Sixties boxes,TRUE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_5,One building stands+out in this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity a dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands right across the Thames from Wren dome,TRUE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_6,This is not an office+block nor a church although its sublime form might suggest that its architect was adept at designing cathedrals,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_7,It is in fact the now redundant oil-fired electric power+station that sits on Bankside next+to the site of Sam Wanamaker new Globe Theatre,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_8,Bankside Power+Station should never have been built,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_9,Its architect had spent the war years with fellow Royal Academicians planning the orderly and spacious London of the future free of smoke and industry,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_10,But when asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power+station that had been on the site since 1891 he soon forgot such idealism and like any architect was glad to have the job,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_11,The project was controversial and the power+station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of St Paul,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_12,So the single chimney rose only to 325ft some 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_13,The irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak scrubbers been less efficient the smoke would have gone straight up into the air,FALSE,train,,3
a4d-fragment02_14,As it was the smokeless shimmer of vapour was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on Wren great dome,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_15,Bankside Power Station+should not have been built,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_16,But as it was built it should not now be demolished,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_17,That is because it is a magnificent structure the supreme architectural expression of the heroic monumental phase of power+station design and the creation of a great architect,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_18,Bankside was the work of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott OM the architect of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral the rebuilt House of Commons and some of the last vital products of the Gothic Revival,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_19,He was a designer of extraordinary versatility being responsible for the standard traditional red telephone kiosk Waterloo Bridge and several power+stations,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_20,Bankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_21,Scott first venture into this unlikely field of design was at Battersea where in 1930 he was wheeled+in as a famous knighted architect by the London Power Company to try to make acceptable the coal-fired monster power+station to which the residents of Chelsea and Westminster were taking strong exception,FALSE,train,,8
a4d-fragment02_22,This was a brilliant move,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_23,Scott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with jazz-modern fluting as John Betjeman called it that when the Battersea A station was opened in 1934 it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_24,When in 1939 The Architects Journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern buildings in Britain Battersea was placed second and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as Sir Kenneth Clark Rebecca West and Charles Laughton,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_25,Scott was so pleased with the style he had evolved at Battersea a treatment that humanised industrial forms without denying their function that he also used it on the Guinness Factory at Park Royal west London,FALSE,train,,5
a4d-fragment02_26,At Battersea Scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the upturned table appearance created by the four corner chimneys,TRUE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_27,At Bankside however he was able to persuade the engineers Mott Hay - Anderson to gather all the flues into a single slender tower or campanile,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_28,As a result he was able to create a symmetrical monumental composition of great power,TRUE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_29,As at all his power+stations Scott faced the building in a fine Worcestershire brick that has weathered to a lovely pinky-brown,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_30,But there is nothing homely about the general effect,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_31,Vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detail,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_32,The result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century with strong American overtones,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_33,When the campanile is seen from a distance it seems to belong to some strange Expressionist church one has not noticed before,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_34,Not for nothing were such power+stations described as brick cathedrals Bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition,TRUE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_35,Now it is redundant,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_36,Smoke shimmers no+longer from the tall tower,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_37,But Bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which like the best mills of the Industrial Revolution is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_38,Such re-use is of+course much encouraged by a building being listed something which until recently was not possible with architecture of so recent a date,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_39,Two years ago however the Department of the Environment at+last began the listing of post-war buildings in England that were more+than 30 years old,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_40,Bracken House the former home of the Financial Times became the first candidate and English Heritage then submitted some 70 recommendations to the Department of the Environment these included Bankside,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_41,This however was too much for the Government and using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings Lord Caithness the Minister of State for the Environment arbitrarily whittled+down English Heritage list to 18 buildings excluding Bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the Fifties to the now-unfashionable Modern Movement,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_42,However Caithness himself stated that this first selection was in no way a definitive list,FALSE,test,,
a4d-fragment02_43,I have no doubt that others will be added,FALSE,train,,6
a4d-fragment02_44,The important thing is that the Thirty Year Rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our times,FALSE,test,,

a7y-fragment03_17,The decision,FALSE,test,,
a7y-fragment03_18,Mr Justice Hutchison said the 1936 Act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance,FALSE,test,,

a9j-fragment01_4,Its two main slogans repeated countless times in the directives issued by the underground leadership are freedom and independence,FALSE,train,,7
a9j-fragment01_5,It has employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objectives,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_6,First a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severed or minimised all the contact points by which they were bound to the Israeli occupation authority,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_7,This campaign included resignations of Palestinian officials from public posts the boycott of Israeli goods and products and the refusal to pay taxes and fines,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_8,Partial and full strikes demonstrations sit-ins conventions all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_9,The second and complementary part of the Intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_10,As Israel authority was being lifted the population began creating an alternative authority of their own,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_11,Popular committees were established in villages refugee camps suburbs streets in fact in every community,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_12,Some headway was made in expanding self-sufficiency whether through utilising more land for agriculture developing home economies or encouraging local manufacturers and products,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_13,Villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into liberated or independent areas if not militarily then at+least psychologically politically and infrastructurally,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_14,Bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages storming through makeshift defensive road+blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear+gas but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_15,Palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires road+blocks would again be erected and life in all its aspects would once+again be run by the local leadership,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_16,The structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests there have been more+than 50 arrests since the Intifada outbreak and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy,TRUE,train,,5
a9j-fragment01_17,While the entire network of popular committees local institutions and the general public constitute the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure a rotating Unified National Command acts in the role of field-general issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmes,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_18,A high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of roles and ideas and retains for the Unified National Command the closeness to grass roots that is required to make it truly reflect people wishes and sentiments,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_19,THIS expanded network of popular committees and institutions making+up the Unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to or identify with the different factions of the PLO,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_20,In effect therefore the PLO exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territories,FALSE,test,,

a9j-fragment01_32,The Intifada is the midwife of freedom,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_33,Through it Palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake+off Israel authority and to construct their own,TRUE,train,,5
a9j-fragment01_34,The struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness by which people have come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changed,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_35,Thus wherever one looks one finds people engaged in the construction of the blocks that will make+up the Palestinian state,TRUE,test,,

a9j-fragment01_37,The masses are being engaged in the craft of state-masonry,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_38,In this process of state building many stages have been covered,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_39,The Declaration of Independence issued by the Palestine National Council PNC on November 15 last year constitutes a major landmark along this road,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_40,Its significance lies in its double message that the aim of the Palestinian struggle is the establishment of Palestinian independence and that this independence is regarded as being not at Israel expense,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_41,This has been a constant theme of Intifada policy that we wish to build Palestine not to destroy Israel that we wish to achieve freedom for our people not to deprive others Israelis of it that we wish to protect and save lives ours not to endanger the lives of others Israelis,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_42,In one of several Intifada leaflets written in Hebrew and addressed to the Israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territories the message was repeated Soldier go home,FALSE,test,,

a9j-fragment01_47,How can the process of state building be developed,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_48,If the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major landmark in this process the time has come to embark on another major step that of declaring the setting+up of a state or government structure,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_49,AN ESCALATION of the Intifada in this direction would serve two purposes at+once,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_50,First it would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_51,Second it would consolidate the image and essence of the Intifada as a constructive not a destructive force,FALSE,train,,4
a9j-fragment01_52,Naturally to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_53,Rather it is a challenge,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_54,It will be a further challenge to Israel occupation conceived in the image of earlier challenges of the Intifada,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_55,But it will also be a challenge to us Palestinians summoning us to work more energetically towards the idea fulfilment,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_56,It would be a natural extension of the Intifada dual strategy towards disengagement from Israel and the corresponding process of state building,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_57,It would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of Palestinian independence,TRUE,train,,8
a9j-fragment01_58,It would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form of organisation and structure,TRUE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_59,It would enable better planning and performance,FALSE,test,,
a9j-fragment01_60,It would maximise civilian tactics of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by Israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local Palestinians,TRUE,test,,
